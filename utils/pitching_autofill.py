"""Utilities for assigning pitchers to staff roles.

This module provides logic used by the ``PitchingEditor`` UI to automatically
assign available pitchers to staff roles in a sensible manner.  Starters are
chosen for the rotation before relievers, and relievers are distributed to the
bullpen with closers favoring low endurance arms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    players:
        An iterable of ``(player_id, data)`` pairs where ``data`` is a mapping
        containing at least ``endurance`` and attributes usable by
        :func:`utils.pitcher_role.get_role`.

    The algorithm prefers starting pitchers (``SP``) for the rotation.  If
    there are not enough starters, the highest-endurance relievers are used to
    fill any remaining rotation spots.  Bullpen roles are then assigned using
    the remaining relievers, with the long reliever getting the highest
    endurance and the closer getting the lowest endurance.
