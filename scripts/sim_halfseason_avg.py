"""Simulate a half 81-game season and report average box score stats.

For lengthy runs this script can benefit from PyPy's JIT or by invoking
CPython with ``python -O`` to skip asserts. When using PyPy ensure required
C extensions such as ``bcrypt`` are available; GUI-focused modules like
``PyQt6`` are not needed here.
