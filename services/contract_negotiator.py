"""Utilities for handling contract decisions during the offseason.

The functions in this module provide very small abstractions that help with
common contract related tasks in simulations:

* :func:`find_expiring_contracts` identifies which players need new deals.
* :func:`evaluate_free_agent_bids` picks the winning team for an unsigned
  player based on competing salary offers.

These routines are intentionally lightweight â€“ they do not attempt to model
complex negotiations or arbitration systems but rather serve as building
blocks for a more detailed front office simulation.
