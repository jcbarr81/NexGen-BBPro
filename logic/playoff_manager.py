"""Utilities for determining playoff qualifiers and bracket scheduling.

This module provides a small :class:`PlayoffManager` that can be used to
select the top teams from regular-season standings, build a simple playoff
bracket and persist that structure for later simulation.  The implementation
is intentionally lightâ€‘weight but fully documented and tested so other parts
of the project can rely on a stable API.
