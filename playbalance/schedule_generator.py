"""Utilities for generating season schedules.

This module produces a basic full-season schedule for a league.  The
current implementation generates a double round-robin schedule where each
team plays every other team twice: once at home and once away.  Games are
scheduled on consecutive days starting from a provided start date.

The function returns a list of dictionaries with ``date`` (ISO formatted
string), ``home`` team and ``away`` team keys.  The simple data structure
is easy for callers or tests to consume and can be written to disk using
:func:`save_schedule` if desired.

The algorithm supports both even and odd numbers of teams.  For an odd
number of teams a bye is automatically inserted each round and games
involving the bye are skipped.
