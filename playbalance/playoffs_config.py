"""Playoffs configuration with sensible MLB-style defaults.

This module centralizes knobs for postseason shape so leagues of different
sizes can opt into brackets of 4, 6, or 8 teams per league and customize
series lengths and home/away patterns.

Defaults are chosen to mirror modern MLB conventions while staying flexible
enough for fictional leagues:

- 6 teams per league (top 2 division winners get a bye; wild-card round)
- BO3 wildcard, BO5 division series, BO7 LCS and World Series
- Home/away patterns: BO3 1-1-1, BO5 2-2-1, BO7 2-3-2

If a config file exists at ``data/playoffs_config.json`` it will be loaded to
override these defaults. Missing keys fall back to defaults.
