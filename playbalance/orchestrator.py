"""Season simulation orchestrator built on the full game engine.

This module delegates game resolution to :class:`logic.season_simulator.SeasonSimulator`
so that pitching staffs and lineups naturally rotate following season rules.
Aggregated league statistics are collected from generated box scores which
mirror real MLB rates when using the tuned playâ€‘balance configuration.

The public helpers simulate a specified number of games by generating a simple
schedule for two example teams.  Convenience wrappers are provided for common
progression increments like a day, week, month or full 162 game season.  When
executed as a script the module prints key stat averages compared to MLB
benchmarks.
