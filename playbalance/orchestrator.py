"""Season simulation orchestrator built on the full game engine.

Independent game simulations are run for a simple two-team schedule and
aggregated into league-wide statistics. Games are executed in parallel using a
``ProcessPoolExecutor`` to speed up large simulations while maintaining
reproducibility.

The public helpers simulate a specified number of games by generating a simple
schedule for two example teams. Convenience wrappers are provided for common
progression increments like a day, week, month or full 162 game season. When
executed as a script the module prints key stat averages compared to MLB
benchmarks.
