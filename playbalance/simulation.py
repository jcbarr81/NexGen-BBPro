        ``foulPitchBasePct`` is the league-wide percentage of pitches that end
        in a foul ball while ``foulStrikeBasePct`` expresses that rate on a
        per-strike basis (~36% of strikes become fouls). ``ballInPlayPitchPct``
        represents the share of all pitches put in play and is used together
        with ``foulPitchBasePct`` to determine the overall contact rate. The
        resulting conversion yields roughly half of contacted pitches as balls
        in play and preserves the strike-based foul percentage without forcing
        a 1:1 split.

        ``foulContactTrendPct`` adds roughly ``+1.5`` percentage points for
        every 20 point edge in batter contact over pitcher movement. ``dist``
        allows far out-of-zone pitches to reduce foul likelihood while
        ``misread`` boosts the chance so complete misreads produce foul tips
        instead of whiffs.
