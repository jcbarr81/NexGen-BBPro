"""Training plan helpers used by the spring training camp flow.

The goal is to make training outcomes feel intentional without replacing the
full franchise-mode development pipeline.  Every player gets a lightweight
plan that:

* Picks a focus track (contact, defense, etc.) based on potential gaps.
* Uses the aging curve from :mod:`playbalance.aging` to bias goals for each age.
* Applies capped rating boosts so attributes stay within [0, 99].

The module exposes small dataclasses so UI layers can surface the outcomes.
